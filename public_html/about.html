        <h2 id="geeks">The Internet And Advancements</h2>
             <p>Going back to 1969 in the history of modern computer and device networking, when Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)
             became the first connected computer network. It implemented the TCP/IP protocol suite, which later became the Internet. ARPANET was
             developed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a subset of the US Department of Defense. Why did the DoD need to develop
             networked computers? The goal of ARPANET was to keep lines of communication open if the USA and the USSR decided to exchange nuclear devices.
             Below is a timeline of events on how everything started with the computer network about 52 years ago to what we know now as the Internet.</p>
<br>
            <p id="title">Computer Network Key Chronological Events</p>
                    <p>1958- ARPA (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA">Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>) was created to improve technological advances.</p>
                    <p>1968- First people who worked in the network idea or project to have computers to communicate.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)">Bob Taylor</a> wanted to build one single network and asked for funding for work in a computer network.</li>
                            <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Roberts_(scientist)">Lawrence Roberts</a> created the first network between two computers and designed the computer network.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>1969- All four sites were interconnected: UCLA, SRI, UCSB, University of Utah.</p>
                    <p>1971-  <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/ARPANET#:~:text=ARPANET%20was%20the%20network%20that,interconnection%20of%20four%20university%20computers.">ARPANET</a> had 18 mainframe computers connected to the network.</p>
                    <p>1971- Email application (Killer app) introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)">Raymond Tomlinson</a>.</p>
                    <p>1972- ARPANET demonstrated the computer network in Washington DC.</p>
                    <p>1973- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)">Vint Cerf</a>(See 2nd picture in the right) and Bob Kahn worked together to develop rules and procedures known as TCP/IP Protocol that would allow passing packets back and forth. </p>
                    <p>1983- <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/">TCP/IP</a> was introduced as the universal standard of protocols.</p>
                    <p>1992- The Internet became public by a bill passed by Congress and became law a few months after.</p>
