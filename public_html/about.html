        <br>
        When we are writing test, we must follow a pattern that will help the developer to make sure everything is tested
        and that every action in the code works as expected. There three ways you can write good tests with Arrange, Act and Assert pattern.
        <h2 id="geeks">Definitions</h2>
            <p id="paraHeaders">Arrange</p>
                <p>This where all test cases are set up and organize in way that can be easily followed and clearly defined.
                    We can have a better picture what are the test that will take action in the following procedures of the AAA testing.</p>
            <p id="paraHeaders2">Act</p>
                <p> This is a significant procedure because this cover the main part of the function to be tested, and developer should keep
                    a clear understanding that is the good and desire output of this test.</p>
            <p id="paraHeaders3">Assert</p>
                <p>This is connected to the ACT procedure where assert checks for quality of the output. Assertions will ultimately determine if the test passes or fails.</p>

                    <p>In 1989 these events happened:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> (Figure.4) developed a software for easier and manageable ways to follow the information on the Internet known as the World Wide Web.</li>
                            <li>There were only 50 web pages on the Internet.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>In 1993 these events happened:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <a href="https://a16z.com/author/marc-andreessen/">Marc Andreessen</a> introduced a user-friendly software to browse the World Wide Web called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">Mosaic</a>.</li>
                            <li>Mosaic was one of the first web browsers introduced that became the signature of todayâ€™s Internet.</li>
