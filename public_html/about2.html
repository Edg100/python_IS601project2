            <p>ARPANET was mainly developed as a government defense tool and isolated to few universities and government projects, and never meant to be used for personal matters.
            However, the World Wide Web made the Internet more accessible to everyone in the world. Everything that started as a government investment and an expensive project
            is now one of the best inventions of humankind. Many companies developed, and took advantage of this computer network and became what they are today. During the
            last decades, the Internet has shown how effective and crucial is for our lives, and how connected society is thanks to this innovative technology</p>
