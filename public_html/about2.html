        <br>
            <p>Software testing is a critical aspect for any software development activity because developers, and testers can
                ensure that all components work the way they were designed. With sufficient testing, developers are also reducing
                the chances that bugs are discovered after implementation of these systems which can be costly to any industry.
                There are some process or tools that software developers and engineers can use such as AAA testing and OOP principles.
                They help to explain the mechanism that we can follow to elaborate proper testing and a well design program.
                At the end, it doesn't matter if the program deliver the expected result to the clients, what it really matters is if we
                follow all testing techniques that would prevent system downtimes that would generate into expensive and time-consuming fixes. </p>
