            <h2>Python Overview</h2>
                <p> Python is a "popular" programming language that is used in many areas from machine learning to building
                    websites, and software testing. This program is very flexible, and designed to be used by programmers
                    and non-programmers, and this is the reason of its popularity. Python is typically used for developing
                    websites, data analyses, automation of tasks, among other activities. </p>

                <p> <a href="https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/">Pylint</a> is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks
                    for code smells. It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular
                    blocks can be refactored and can offer you details about the code's complexity.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes pylint thinks there is an issue in your code even tough it is fine. We can disable those
                            messages (See Figure 7). For example, we may get an error saying error with redefined-outer-name or unused-argument.
                            We can write #pylint: disable="error message" , in the lines wherever Pylint is reporting these errors. </p>

                <h3 id="title6">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Main Components</h3>
                    <p id="paraHeaders10">Factory</p>
                        <p>The term factory in programming is basically a place in the code where we can create and return a function. This
                            facilitates the return of many functions from a parameter's function, and provides a great benefit
                            when creating new functions. In Figure 9, it shows a factory function from our calculator project
                            where two attributes are returned (num_a and num_b) after values are inserted into the testing or execution of the code.
                        </p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders11">Instantiation</p>
                        <p>For our calculator project we created a class instantiation (see Figure 9) with a created instance of class
                            in this case called "Calculation" and the constructor parameters. Therefore, instantiation is the process to create
                            objects from a class to be used in another class or function.</p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders12">Object</p>
                        <p>An object is an element, data also known as instance of a class because it contains all attributes
                            and methods that a class need to integrate a complete system. In Figure 9, we see an object called
                            "self" which represents the object inside the class that is being shared with other child classes such as addition and division.</p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders13">Class </p>
                        <p>Now, a class is a set of objects with similar behaviour where attributes and methods share some similarities.
                            In figure 9 (see below), Calculation is the class compose by objects and methods. </p>

                    <p id="paraHeaders14">Namespace</p>
                        <p>It is a collection of names that are organized in a way that is easy to find in the code where
                            the classes are originated in the code. An example will be calc.division where calc is the folder where
                            all calculation are located, and division is the class that we are getting the information. (See Figure 10)</p>

                    <p id="paraHeaders15" >Constructor</p>
                        <p>This is the first part in the code that is processed whenever an object is created and instantiated.
                            For example in Figure 9 (see above), we have 3 objects defined in the parameter that means the constructor is called 3 times.</p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders16">Fixture</p>
                        <p>It is a function that will run before each test function. This can be seemed as a database that
                            provides some data to the test methods, and is used by Pytest to read and execute each test function.
                            This is the command that is used for fixture :@pytest.fixture. In the calculator project, we have a
                            file called calculation.py (See Figure 11 below) and there we have a fixture defined that will be
                            executed by Pytest for every value pass into the function. </p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders17">Type Hinting</p>
                        <p>Type hinting is used to indicate the type of value the parameter in the function is.
                        In our example below (Figure 10), it shows that the type of values from the factory method needs to be tuple.</p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders18">Type Casting</p>
                        <p>Type casting is a method utilize to covert the values inside a return function into a desired
                            data that the developer needs in the code. From one of our branches for the calculator project (part 5)
                            , we are saying here that the values inside the return function have to tuple. (See Figure 10 below) </p>

                    <p id="paraHeaders19">Unit Test</p>
                        <p>The purpose for unit test is to test a specific part of the code, and to ensure is intended to
                            do one single task or operation with few inputs and to return a single output. Figure 11 illustrates
                            a unit test for addition for the calculator project, we are basically testing if the calculator add two numbers and return the result expected. </p>

                    <p id="paraHeaders20">Static</p>
                        <p>The word static in programming language means that a member is on class level rather on the instance level.
                        Therefore, variables that are static are within the class, and they are not instantiated. Figure 12 shows
                        a static method that are within the calculator class only.</p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders21">Class Method</p>
                        <p> Class method is a method that pertains to the class and not the attributes or functions of the same class.
                            In figure 9, we see the class method in the calculation file where the parameter cls is there to take the first parameter only.</p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders22">Facade</p>
                        <p>Facade is one of the design patterns used in OOP that act as interface between clients and the
                            subsystem components to reduce complexity. We can see this pattern being used in our calculator project
                            where there is a class with multiple and simplified methods. For example, in the calculation class which
                            deals with 4 different methods: addition, division, subtraction and multiplication. </p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders23">Design Patterns Used in the Calculator Project</p>
                        <p>Facade is the designed pattern used for the calculator project because we can manage all
                            interfaces in this case 4 math operations (division, addition, subtraction and multiplication)
                            into a one interface to use as the main one. </p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders24">Method</p>
                        <p>Method is a process or procedure that an object perform. Figure 12 shows methods that perform
                            a unique function in the calculator class.</p>
                    <p id="paraHeaders25">Property</p>
                        <p>A property in OOP is a composed by one or two functions (get and set) that retrieves and sets a value.
                        In figure 12, we can see the history property that retrieves the information from all the methods, and set
                        the value accordingly. </p>
